Lecture 3    Pipes / Grep / File Permissions

stdout is buffered, stderr is not

=== Motivating Example ===
	Q: How many words occur in the first 10 lines of sample.txt
	   --
	   | $> head -10 sample.txt > temp.txt
	   | $> wc -w temp.txt
	   | $> rm temp.txt
	   --
	Connect the output of one program to be the input of the next program
			stdin1  ---------  stdin2   ---------
		 ---------->| prog1 |---------->| prog2 | ------> use a pipe
		            --------- stdout1   ---------
    $> head -10 sample.txt | wc -w


Q: Suppose files words1.txt & words2.txt contain list of words, one per line.
   Print a duplicate free list of all words in words*.txt

   $> cat words*.txt | sort | uniq 
   							   |
   							  doesn't eliminate words that are not consecutive

Use the output of a program as an argument to another
	- use backquotes ` `
	  eg. $> echo Today is `date`
	- double quotes will still allow embedded commands to execute
	  eg. $> echo "Today is `date`"
	- single quotes will not

=== Search Within a File ===
	grep: global regular expression pattern
	egrep: extended grep
	usage: $> egrep pattern file
					   |
					any regular expression
	output: prints every line in file that contains the pattern
	eg. $> egrep "CS246|cs246" file
		$> egrep "(cs|CS)246" file
		$> egrep "(c|C)(s|S)246" file


	[abc] === a|b|c   ->any one character from this list
	[^abc]            ->any one character not in this list
	?				  ->0 or 1 of the preceding expression
	*				  ->0 or more of the preceding expression
	+				  ->1 or more of the preceding expression
	.				  ->any one character
	.* 				  ->0 or more of any character
	.+				  ->1 or more of any character
	^				  ->matched lines must begin with the pattern
	$				  ->matched lines must end with the pattern
	\ 				  ->to escape a character with special meanings, except inside[]
	eg. $> egrep "CS ?246" -> CS246/CS 246
		$> egrep "(CS ?)?246" -> CS246/CS 246/246
		$> egrep "(CS )?246" -> CS 246/246
		$> egrep "^CS246"
		$> egrep "CS246$"
		$> egrep "^CS246$" -> lines containing just CS246
		$> egrep "\*"
		$> egrep "\?"
	Q: Print all word of even length from /usr/share/dict/words.
	   $> egrep "^(..)+$" /usr/share/dict/words

	Q: Print all files in the current directory, whose name contains exactly 1 a.
	   $> ls | egrep "^[^a]*a[^a]*$"
